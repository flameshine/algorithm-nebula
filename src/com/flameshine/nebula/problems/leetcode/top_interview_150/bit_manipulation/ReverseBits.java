/**
 * â„–190 Reverse Bits
 *
 * Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *   - Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
 *     In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type.
 *     They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
 *   - In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation.
 *     Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
