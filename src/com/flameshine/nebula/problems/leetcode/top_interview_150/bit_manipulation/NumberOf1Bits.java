/**
 * â„–191 Number of 1 Bits
 *
 * Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *   - Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
 *     In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type.
 *     They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
 *   - In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation.
 *     Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -3.
