/**
 * â„–13 Roman to Integer
 *
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
 * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
 * 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II.
 * The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
 * However, the numeral for four is not IIII.
 * Instead, the number four is written as IV.
 * Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
 * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
 *
 * There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 *
 *   - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 *   - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 *   - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 *
 * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
