/**
 * â„–1051 Height Checker
 *
 * A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students.
 * The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height.
 * Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
 * You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in.
 * Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
 * Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].
